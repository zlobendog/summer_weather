# Summer Weekends Curse
## a simple data analytics on weather patterns in Absheron, Azerbaijan

Have you ever felt like weather has something against you? In the long hot summer days when you are working away at your cubicle, you can't help but wander off imagining how good would it feel to jump right into the water on one of the Absheron beaches. If you live in Baku, that is. And so for the whole week you just count the days until it's weekend and you can finally go to the beach and relax - it is summer, after all. 

Granted, 2020 is not like any other years we've had. Going to the beach was not an option for most of us for almost entirety of this summer. Yet, even then some of you had probably noticed one peculiar phenomena: weekdays are fine and dandy as far as the beach weather go, but as soon as the weekend rolls in - something will surely be off: be it gusts of strong wind, heavy dark clouds or even rain.  

Is it just a coincidence? Or, maybe, our mind plays tricks on us? Can it be that we are just more likely to remember instances of bad weather on the weekends and take instances of good weather for granted? 

Well, wonder no more! Me, your faithful data science ninja, will guide you through years of data to the answer to that secret!
